# ZangdorGames Helpers

This is a collection of extenstions or tools that are use on ZangdorGames projects.

Those tools are inspired of assets like DTT utilities or ProLibrary and videos like [Unite 2016 - Overthrowing the MonoBehaviour Tyranny in a Glorious Scriptable Object Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo) and [Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)
